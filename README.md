# Next.js Web3 Auth Playground

**Purpose**: Test out various approaches for securely passing a connected user's session data (such as their address) from the client to the server using Next.js 13 app routes.

While researching this I came across https://github.com/m1guelpf/nextjs13-connectkit-siwe/ which solves a majority of the questions I had around using ConnectKit since I typically have used RainbowKit.
